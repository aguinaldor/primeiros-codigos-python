# What are Strings?
name = "Michael Jackson"
# or single marks
name= 'Michael Jackson'
# A string can be a combination of spaces and digits
'1 2 3 4 5 6 '
# A string can be a combination of special characters
'!@@#$%¨%¨&"
# We can print our using the print statement
print ("hello!")
# Indexing
It is helpfull to think of a string as an ordered sequence. Each element in the sequence can be accessed using an index represented by array of numbers.

# Name= Michael Jackson
# M i c h a e l   J a c  k  s  o  n
# 0  1  2  3  4  5  6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
# print(name[0])
# M
# print(name[6])
# l
# negative index
# Michael Jackson
# -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
# print (name [-1])
# n
# print (name [-14]
# M
# We can find the number of characters in a string (quantidade de caracteres )
len ("michael jacskson")
# 15  caracters
#Slicing
 we can obtain multiple characteres from a string using slicing, we can obtain the 0 to 4th and 8th to the 12th element
      name="Michael Jackson"
#MICHAEL JACKSON
NAME[O:4] = MICH NAME[8:12]= JACK
#stride
We can also input a stride value as follow, with '2' indicating that we are selecting every seconf variable:
#Name "michael jackson"
name[::2]: "mcaljcsn"
#Concatenate
